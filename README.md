# US-Pollution-Analysis

I used Power BI to create an interactive five-page report that provides valuable insights, such as identifying the
top 10 states with the highest pollution levels and pinpointing the most polluted city based on the maximum
Air Quality Index (AQI). I accomplished this by employing tables, charts, slicers, cards, text boxes, and other
visualizations.

The dataset covers a span of five years, from 2006 to 2010, and contains information on four major pollutants: CO,
NO2, SO2, and O3, each having specific columns.

To ensure data accuracy, I performed data cleansing and created measures, as well as added new columns to the
dataset to meet the projectâ€™s requirements
